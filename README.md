By Chao Li, Xinggang Wang, Wenyu Liu and Longin Jan Latecki
Codes for our MIA paper "DeepMitosis: Mitosis detection via deep detection, verification and segmentation networks".


Our detection model is based on Faster R-CNN model. We use the py-faster-rcnn framework. You need to firstly install the py-faster-rcnn  following the directions at: https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn.
